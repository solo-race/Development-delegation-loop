# Development Delegation Loop

Load this skill once in the main supervisor. The supervisor owns routing and state; workers receive only bounded role-specific context.

## Mandatory session gate

On first activation, if supervision has not already been explicitly declared for this session, ask exactly one user decision before starting work:

`Session supervision: is a human supervisor actively present for this session? [Yes/No]`

Set `human_supervisor=true` for Yes and `false` for No. Do not infer supervision from time of day, user activity, or prior sessions. Keep the value stable for the session unless the user changes it.

## Route selection

After the session gate, inspect current HEAD plus the minimum project/plan documents needed to classify the task.

Enter the **planning loop** when either condition is true:
- the user explicitly asks to plan, re-plan, decompose, or phase the work;
- the current phase has no usable detailed phase plan.

A usable detailed phase plan names the current phase objective, bounded implementation units, dependencies/order, material scope and constraints, validation for each unit, and phase exit criteria. A roadmap or phase list alone is not sufficient.

Otherwise enter the **implementation loop**.

After planning is sealed, return to route selection; normally the new current-phase plan then enters implementation.

## Supervision policy

`human_supervisor=true` -> supervised execution. Run the implementation loop without automatic independent review. The human remains the live escalation/review authority.

`human_supervisor=false` -> unattended execution. Run implementation plus the independent review module at each phase-close boundary. A phase does not advance until review returns `PASS`. `REVISE` findings are converted into bounded repair work, revalidated, and reviewed again. Stop on `BLOCK`, an unresolved planning/architecture decision, or a deployment-defined review budget.

The same review module may gate a newly created plan in unattended planning. In supervised planning, do not add an automatic reviewer unless the user asks for one.

## Roles

- **Main supervisor**: owns routing, session mode, delegation, evidence comparison, persisted state, and retry/review transitions.
- **Scout**: read-only repository/document inspection; returns source-backed facts and separates inference.
- **Planner**: reasons over a prepared planning packet and produces or revises the project/phase plan; it does not perform broad repository discovery itself.
- **Implementer**: changes only the bounded implementation brief.
- **Test executor**: runs requested validation and reports reproducible evidence without repairing failures.
- **Reviewer**: independent read-only audit of a plan or mechanically completed phase; returns `PASS`, `REVISE`, or `BLOCK` and does not implement fixes.

## Shared boundaries

- Prefer current HEAD and direct evidence over stale summaries or prior conversation.
- Keep repository discovery with scouts; expensive reasoning roles should receive compressed, source-backed packets.
- The supervisor coordinates and accepts; it is not the fallback implementer or planner.
- Material repository-state changes invalidate affected evidence.
- Record only work actually performed and validation actually observed.
- Architecture changes, irreversible/migration/permission/data-loss decisions, or scope expansion require explicit plan-level authority.

## States

Implementation units end as `ACCEPTED`, `RETRY_IMPLEMENTATION`, `REVERIFY`, `BLOCKED`, or `ESCALATE_PLAN`.

A mechanically complete phase is `READY_FOR_REVIEW` when unattended and becomes `PHASE_ACCEPTED` only after reviewer `PASS`. Under human supervision, mechanical acceptance may directly produce `PHASE_ACCEPTED` unless the human requests review.

Planning ends as `PLAN_SEALED`, `NEED_EVIDENCE`, `REVISE_PLAN`, or `BLOCKED`.
